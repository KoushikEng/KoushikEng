I like understanding systems end-to-end, from hardware and firmware to backend software and real users.

### Background
- Ex-founder of an embedded / IoT startup (acquired, NDA)
- Built and shipped production systems under real constraints

### Focus
- End-to-end systems
- Backend APIs & control logic
- AI agents (from first principles)
- CLI-first, automation-friendly tools

I value clarity, ownership, and fundamentals that compound.
